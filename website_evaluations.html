				<h5>
					Zillow is a site where you can look at real-estate for sale or compare home prices.
					<ul>
						<li>Contrast(9/10): The blue titles are starkly contrasted with the white background as well as the black links. Also the size of the titles versus the smaller links or body texts is great too.</li>
						<li>Repetition(8/10): Does a great job at using the same size, font, and color for links as well as options on the site. There are few too many fonts used on the mainpage however.</li>
						<li>Alignment(10/10): All the placement of the text and images make sense and proper spacing is used between them as well as centering and proper alignment for important information or images.</li>
						<li>Proximity(9/10): Links at the header and footer are grouped together properly. The title is seperated and the body options are properly set up next to each other.</li>
					</ul>

		<h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/" target="_blank">craigslist.org</a></h3>
		<section> 				
				<h5>
					Craigslist is a website where you can find people selling their personal items or list your own items.
					<ul>
						<li>Contrast(6/10): It contrasts well with the dark blue to white, however this contrast is used across the whole site so every section looks the same. </li>
						<li>Repetition(7/10): This site certainly uses repetition, however it is so used there seems to be no visual differences between any sections. </li>
						<li>Alignment(4/10): Proper spacing is needed to allow for better organization and more space. Placement of sections feels random and out of line with other sections.</li>
						<li>Proximity(2/10): Everything feels smooshed together and cluttered. Sections have little space and are crammed into one box.</li>
					</ul>
